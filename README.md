In this project, I have defined and created a simple relational database, applying concepts of relational data modeling with SQLAlchemy to define database entities.  I have Translated given SQL table creation statements into SQLAlchemy models following the declarative mapping style.  Running python manage.py init creates a db file called 'site.db' with the appropriate SQl table creation statements.
