In this project, I have defined and created a simple relational database, applying concepts of relational data modeling with SQLAlchemy to define database entities.  I have Translated given SQL table creation statements into SQLAlchemy models following the declarative mapping style.  Running python manage.py init creates a db file called 'site.db' with the appropriate SQl table creation statements. 

In the second sprint I have created a test database with additional models seeded with synthetic data in order to verify my tables are successfully created and behave as expected when inserting data.
